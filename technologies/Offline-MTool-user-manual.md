# Offline MTool User Manual

## 1 Introduction

In order to facilitate node pledge, commission and governance related operations, PlatON provides MTool to assist users.

- MTool supports Ubuntu 18.04 and Windows 10. This document describes the installation and use of Windows 10.
- MTool needs to connect to the verification node through RPC interface. For the installation and deployment of verification node, please refer to [PlatON node installation and deployment manual.md](./ PlatON node installation and deployment manual.md)
- To ensure node security, it is recommended that node RPC ports be accessed through Nginx proxy. Nginx uses Https and user authentication to strengthen security protection
- MTool provides two signature methods for transactions such as pledge: online signature and offline signature. This document describes the offline signature operation. For online signature, please refer to [Online MTool User Manual.md](./Online-MTool-user-manual.md)

## 3 Configuration

### 3.1 Wallet Configuration

#### 3.1.1 Basic concepts

* Cold wallets: wallets stored on offline machines, not exposed to the Internet
* Observe wallet: wallet containing cold wallet address, cannot make transactions, only view data
* Hot Wallet: Wallet exposed to the Internet

#### 3.1.2 Create a cold wallet

If the user does not have a wallet, execute the command on the**offline machine**to generate a pledge wallet and a profit wallet; if there is already a wallet, you can copy the wallet file to the**keystore**directory of the decompressed package of the offline MTool through the storage medium. Skip this step.

- Create pledge wallet

```bash
mtool-client.bat create_wallet --name staking
```

- Create earnings wallet

```bash
mtool-client.bat create_wallet --name reward
```

#### 3.1.3 Generate Observation Wallet

- Generate pledge observation wallet

Run the command on the **offline machine**to generate the pledge observation wallet:

```bash
mtool-client.bat create_observewallet --keystore %MTOOLDIR%\keystore\staking.json
```

 Enter the pledged cold wallet password and return the generated observation wallet as follows:

```
please input keystore password: 
SUCCESS
wallet created at: keystore/staking_observed.json
```

- Copy the generated observation wallet file staking_observed.json to the keystore directory of the online machine.
- Generate income observation wallet

Run the command on the **offline machine**to generate the income observation wallet:

```bash
mtool-client.bat create_observewallet --keystore %MTOOLDIR%\keystore\reward.json
```

 Enter the earning cold wallet password and return the generated observation wallet, as follows:

```
please input keystore password: 
SUCCESS
wallet created at: keystore/reward_observed.json
```

- Copy the generated observation wallet file reward_observed.json to the**keystore**directory of**online machine**.

### 3.2 Connect to Validation Node

If authentication node information has been configured, ignore this step. Perform the following steps on**`online machine`**to generate verification node configuration information:

- step1. Browser copy link <https://7w6qnuo9se.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/opensource/scripts/validator_conf.bat> or <http://47.91.153.183/opensource/scripts/validator_conf.bat> Download the script.

## 4 Basic Operation Flow

### 4.1 Generate transaction data

- Generate files to be signed

  Take the pledge operation as an example, execute the pledge operation command on the **online machine**, note that the wallet option command at this time is`--address`

```bash
mtool-client.bat staking --amount 1000000 --address %MTOOLDIR%\keystore\staking_observed.json --config %MTOOLDIR%\validator\validator_config.json
```

Note: staking_observed.json is the observation wallet, which can be modified based on the actual observation wallet.

Return to generate the corresponding file to be signed:

```bash
operation finished
SUCCESS
File generated on transaction_details/transaction_detail_20191108114241.csv
```

Note: transaction_details/transaction_detail_20191108114241.csv is the transaction file to be signed.

- Copy files to be signed to **offline machine**

  Copy the file to be signed %MTOOLDIR%\transaction_details\transaction_detail_20191108114241.csv under **online machine** to **offline machine** via the storage medium.

### 4.2 Offline Signature Transactions

- Generate transaction signature files

Execute the signing command under **offline machine**to sign the pledged transaction:

```bash
mtool-client.bat offlinesign --filelocation %MTOOLDIR%\transaction_details\transaction_detail_20191108114241.csv
```

Note:%MTOOLDIR%\transaction_details\transaction_detail_20191108114241.csv is the file to be signed generated in the previous step, and is modified to the actual file to be signed.

Enter the corresponding cold wallet password and return the signed file. The file content is as follows:

```csv

operation finished
SUCCESS
File generated on transaction_signature / transaction_signature_20191108114625.csv
total: 1, to be signed: 1
success: 1, failure: 0
```

Note: where transaction_signature/transaction_signature_20191108114625.csv is a signed transaction file.

- Copy transaction signature files to online machines

Copy the signed file transaction_signature_20191108114625.csv on the offline machine to the online machine via the storage medium.

### 4.3 Sending Signature Transactions

- Execute online transaction order on **online machine** to complete pledge operation

```bash
mtool-client.bat send_signedtx --filelocation %MTOOLDIR%\transaction_signature\transaction_signature_20191108114625.csv --config %MTOOLDIR%\validator\validator_config.json
```

Note: transaction_signature_20191108114625.csv is the transaction signature file generated in the previous step, and is modified to the actual signature file.

Enter`yes` to return the transaction result:

```bash
Send Transaction? (Yes | no)
yes
transaction 1 success
transaction hash: 0xf14f74386e6ef9027c48582d7faed3b50ab1ffdd047d6ba3afcf27791afb4e9b
SUCCESS
total: 1
success: 1, failure: 0
```

Note: prompting success and returning a transaction hash indicates that the signed transaction was sent successfully, otherwise the signed transaction failed to be sent.

## 5 Detailed MTool operation

This chapter mainly describes the relevant commands for generating transaction to-be-signed files in csv format on the online machine (except [5.5 commissioned reward generation report operation](# 55- commissioned reward generation report operation)), the generated csv file will Save in %MTOOLDIR%\transaction_details directory. Refer to [4 Basic Operation Flow](#4-Basic Operation Flow) for the complete process of sending offline signature transactions.

### 5.1 Initiating a pledge operation

If the consensus nodes are deployed and the blocks have been synchronized successfully, you can use MTool for pledge operations. After the application for pledge funds is completed, ensure that the balance of the pledge account is sufficient, and replace {Pledge Amount} according to the user's situation. The minimum threshold for pledge is 1 million LAT.

>
> restrictedamount: use the account balance to increase the amount of pledge, not less than 10 pledge threshold, the decimal point does not exceed 8

### 5.5 Commissioning rewards to generate report operations

Before performing this operation, you need to start the MTool service on the **online machine**. If it is already started, you can skip this step.

- Execute the start MTool service command

```bash
mtool-server.bat
```

This command will generate **Allocation Reward Details Report** and **Allocation Reward Summary Report**. The reports are stored in the csv file format.

- Edit delegated incentive plan profile

If the reward_config.json file is already configured, you can skip this step.

```bash
copy %MTOOLDIR%\validator\reward_config.json.example %MTOOLDIR%\validator\reward_config.json
```

Edit the reward_config.json file. The file template description is as follows:

```json
{
  // Pledged reward configuration
 "staking": {
    // Reward method: AVERAGE (average distribution of commissioned people), PERCENT (weight distribution of total amount commissioned by the client)
 "rewardMethod": "AVERAGE",
    // Node commission percentage
"commissionRatio": 0.1
 },
    // Block reward configuration
 "block": {
    // Reward method: AVERAGE (average distribution of commissioned people), PERCENT (weight distribution of total amount commissioned by the client)
 "rewardMethod": "AVERAGE",
    // Node commission percentage
"commissionRatio": 0.2
 },
  // Transaction fee reward configuration
 "trade": {
    // Reward method: AVERAGE (average distribution of commissioned people), PERCENT (weight distribution of total amount commissioned by the client)
 "rewardMethod": "AVERAGE",
    // Node commission percentage
"commissionRatio": 0.3
},
  // Payer of transaction fee, DELEGATOR (from the client) VALIDATOR (from the validator)
"feePayer": "DELEGATOR"
}
```

-Edit validation node configuration file

If the startup parameter of the node is added with the **--db.nogc** option, indicating that the node is an archive node, this step can be ignored; otherwise it is a non-archive node and only saves the transaction information of the last 100 blocks to obtain The reward details need to be connected to the archive node. The currently open archive nodes are:**52.233.38.169: 6789** and **13.235.119.163: 6789**. You need to modify the **nodeAddress** parameter in the validator configuration file validator_config.json, other parameters are unchanged:

```json
{
    "nodeRpcPort": "6789",
    "nodeAddress": "http://52.233.38.169"
}
```

- Excuting an order

```bash
mtool-client.bat gen_reward --start_block 10751 --end_block 107500 --rewardconfig %MTOOLDIR%\validator\reward_config.json --config %MTOOLDIR%\validator\validator_config.json
```

- Parameter Description

> address: Must be the wallet address specified by the validator node
>
> start_block: the height of the starting block for issuing incentive statistics, which is 1 or an integer multiple of 10750 (settlement cycle) plus 1
>
> end_block: The cutoff block for issuing incentive statistics is high, which is an integral multiple of 10750 (settlement cycle). The end block must be greater than the start block.
>
> rewardconfig: delegate incentive plan configuration file
